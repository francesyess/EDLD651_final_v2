```{r}

```

```{r}

#and so on... I recommend adding something like this to tidy up the data more. While it's fairly clear what it means in this table, it would look prettier if the names were tidied more.
```

```{r}
schoolingsub1 <- schoolingsub |> 
  mutate(near_college = ifelse(nearc2 == "yes" & nearc4 =="yes", "near_colleges", 
                               ifelse(nearc2 == "yes" & nearc4 =="no","near_cc", 
                                      ifelse(nearc2 == "no" & nearc4 =="yes","near_4yr", "not_near_college"))))

Research question 1: What is the relationship between parent education and participant's education?

### Plot 1

```{r}
schoolingsub1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(par_education, ed76, color = parent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Parent and Participant Education",
       subtitle = "From 1976 Survey",
       x = "Parental Education (yrs)",
       y = "Participant Education (yrs)",
       color = "Parent"
       )

```

Research question 2: What is the relationship between parent education and participant's wage?

### Plot 2

```{r}
schoolingsub1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(par_education, wage76, color = parent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() +
   labs(title = "Relationship between Parent Education and Participant Wages",
       subtitle = "From 1976 Survey",
       x = "Parental Education (yrs)",
       y = "Participant Wages (cents/hr)",
       color = "Parent"
       )
```

Research question 3: Is there a difference in wage depending on whether you lived near a college?

### Table 1

```{r}
schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_4yr", "Near 4-year College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_cc", "Near Community College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_colleges", "Near 4-year  and Community College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("not_near_college", "Not Near College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1 %>%   
  group_by(near_college) |> 
  summarize(avg_wage = mean(wage76, na.rm = TRUE)/100) |>
  rename("Proximity to College" = near_college, "Participant Average Wage per Hour" = avg_wage) %>%
DT::datatable()

#Really like this whole section. Very nice looking table. One thing to consider: round the average wage per hour, as it's not particularly helpful to have a lot of floating decimals out there, and it clutters up the tqble.
```
