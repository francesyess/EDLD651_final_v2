```{r}
schooling <- import(here("data","Schooling.csv"))
```

```{r}
schoolingsub <- schooling %>%
  select(rownames,ed76, daded, momed, wage76, iqscore, age76, nearc2, nearc4)

```

```{r}

```

### Table 1: Demographics

```{r}
schoolingsub1 %>% 
    pivot_wider (names_from = parent,
                values_from = par_education) %>%
   select(-near_college) %>%
  gt() %>%
  cols_label(ed76 = "Participant Education (Yrs)",
             wage76 = "Participant Wage (cents/hr)",
             iqscore = "IQ Score",
             age76 = "Age of Participant",
             nearc2 = "Near Community College",
             nearc4 = "Near Four-Year College",
             dad = "Paternal Education (Yrs)",
             mom = "Maternal Education (Yrs)",
             rownames = "Participant ID")
  
```

Research question 1: What is the relationship between parent education and participant's education?

### Plot 1

```{r}
schoolingsub1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(par_education, ed76, color = parent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Parent and Participant Education",
       subtitle = "From 1976 Survey",
       x = "Parental Education (yrs)",
       y = "Participant Education (yrs)",
       color = "Parent"
       )

```

Research question 2: What is the relationship between parent education and participant's wage?

### Plot 2

```{r}
schoolingsub1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(par_education, wage76, color = parent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() +
   labs(title = "Relationship between Parent Education and Participant Wages",
       subtitle = "From 1976 Survey",
       x = "Parental Education (yrs)",
       y = "Participant Wages (cents/hr)",
       color = "Parent"
       )
```

Research question 3: Is there a difference in wage depending on whether you lived near a college?

### Table 2: Proximity and Wages

```{r}
schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_4yr", "Near 4-year College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_cc", "Near Community College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_colleges", "Near 4-year  and Community College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("not_near_college", "Not Near College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1 %>%   
  group_by(near_college) |> 
  summarize(avg_wage = mean(wage76, na.rm = TRUE)/100) |>
  rename("Proximity to College" = near_college, "Participant Average Wage per Hour" = avg_wage) %>%
DT::datatable()
```
