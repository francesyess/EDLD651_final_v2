```{r}
schooling <- import(here("data","Schooling.csv"))
```

```{r}
schoolingsub <- schooling %>%
  select(rownames,ed76, daded, momed, wage76, iqscore, age76, nearc2, nearc4)

#Note from Ben: One thing to consider is renaming the variable names to more closely reflect what they're measuring. It may help collaborators and reviewers like me understand what's being done in the code a little more.
```

```{r}
schoolingsub1 <- schoolingsub |> 
  mutate(near_college = ifelse(nearc2 == "yes" & nearc4 =="yes", "near_colleges", 
                               ifelse(nearc2 == "yes" & nearc4 =="no","near_cc", 
                                      ifelse(nearc2 == "no" & nearc4 =="yes","near_4yr", "not_near_college")))) 
```

```{r}

  pivot_longer(
    cols = c(daded,momed),
    names_to = "parent",
    values_to = "par_education")

Demographics

```{r}
datasummary_skim(schoolingsub1 |> 
                   pivot_wider (names_from = parent,
                                values_from = par_education) |> 
                   select(-rownames),
                 histogram = FALSE)
```

Research question 1: What is the relationship between parent education and participant's education?

### Plot 1

```{r}
schoolingsub1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(par_education, ed76, color = parent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Relationship between Parent and Participant Education",
       subtitle = "From 1976 Survey",
       x = "Parental Education (yrs)",
       y = "Participant Education (yrs)",
       color = "Parent"
       )

```

Research question 2: What is the relationship between parent education and participant's wage?

### Plot 2

```{r}
schoolingsub1 |> 
  ggplot(aes(par_education, wage76, color = parent)) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) + theme_minimal() +
   labs(title = "Relationship between Parent Education and Participant Wages",
       subtitle = "From 1976 Survey",
       x = "Parental Education (yrs)",
       y = "Participant Wages (cents/hr)",
       color = "Parent"
       )
```

Research question 3: Is there a difference in wage depending on whether you lived near a college?

### Table 1

```{r}
schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_4yr", "Near 4-year College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_cc", "Near Community College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("near_colleges", "Near 4-year  and Community College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1$near_college <- gsub("not_near_college", "Not Near College", schoolingsub1$near_college)

schoolingsub1 %>%   
  group_by(near_college) |> 
  summarize(avg_wage = mean(wage76, na.rm = TRUE)/100) |>
  rename("Proximity to College" = near_college, "Participant Average Wage per Hour" = avg_wage) %>%
DT::datatable()
```

```{r}
schooling_table <- schoolingsub1 %>%   
  group_by(near_college) |> 
  summarize(avg_wage = mean(wage76, na.rm = TRUE)/100) |>
  rename("Proximity to College" = near_college, "Participant Average Wage per Hour" = avg_wage)
```

```{r}
#| output: asis
DT::datatable(schooling_table)
```
